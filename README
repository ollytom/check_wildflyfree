     check_wildflyfree — check wildfly heap memory usage

SYNOPSIS
     check_wildflyfree [−u username] [−p password] [−h host] [−w percentage]
                       [−c percentage]

DESCRIPTION
     check_wildflyfree is a plugin for Nagios/Icinga systems which checks the
     current heap memory usage of a Wildfly server and calculates the percent‐
     age of heap free.

     The options are:

     −u username
             authenticate as username.  The default is wildfly.

     −p password
             authenticate with password.  The default is wildfly.

     −h host
             check heap memory usage at host.  The default is localhost.

     −w percentage
             exit with warning when percentage amount of memory is used.  The
             default is 50.

     −c percentage
             exit with critical when percentage amount of memory is used.  The
             default is 75.

EXIT STATUS
     check_wildflyfree exits with status 0 if the memory usage is below the
     warning threshold.  Otherwise it exits with 1 or 2 if the memory usage is
     above warning or critical respectively.  On any other error it should
     exit with status 3 (UNKNOWN).
